# TextUno
A text-based Uno game that I made for Data Structure course.
Also for when you do not have someone to play Uno with :D

This game only runs in terminal.

## If you wish to try it, here is how to do so:
__Requirement:__ Java JDK 12.0.2 or newer 
1) Open terminal and redirect to wherever you put this game folder in your machine
2) Type all these in the terminal "javac -d . Card.java", "javac -d . MiniDeck.java", "javac -d FullDeck.java", "javac -d PlayersHand.java"
3) Then type 'java finaleproj.Gameplay'
4) Have fun!
